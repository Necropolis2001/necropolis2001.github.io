            <h1>Lady of Nimrodel</h1> 

            <p>The Lady of Nimrodel is a song partially sung by Legolas while he and the Company rested by the river Nimrodel on the night of 15 January T.A. 3019.<br>
                The original song was in Sindarin but Legolas sang the song in the Westron speech.<br>
                The song is incomplete because Legolas had forgotten much of it.<br>
               The song was long and sad, for it told how sorrow came upon Lothlórien when the Dwarves found evil in the mountains.</p> 
          
            <div><p class="colortext">
                An Elven-maid there was of old,<br>
                A shining star by day:<br>
                Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,<br>
                Her shoes of silver-grey.<br><br>
                
                A star was bound upon her brows,<br>
                A light was on her hair<br>
                As sun upon the golden boughs<br>
                In Lórien the fair.<br><br>
                
                Her hair was long, her limbs were white,<br>
                And fair she was and free;<br>
                And in the wind she went as light<br>
                As leaf of linden-tree.<br><br>
                
                Beside the falls of Nimrodel,<br>
                By water clear and cool,<br>
                Her voice as falling silver fell<br>
                Into the shining pool.<br><br>
                
                Where now she wanders none can tell,<br>
                In sunlight or in shade;<br>
                For lost of yore was Nimrodel<br>
                And in the mountains strayed.<br><br>
                
                The elven-ship in haven grey<br>
                Beneath the mountain-lee<br>
                Awaited her for many a day<br>
                Beside the roaring sea.<br><br>
                
                A wind by night in Northern lands<br>
                Arose, and loud it cried,<br>
                And drove the ship from elven-strands<br>
                Across the streaming tide.<br><br>
                </p> 
          
            <p class="colortext">
                When dawn came dim the land was lost,<br>
                The mountains sinking grey<br>
                Beyond the heaving waves that tossed<br>
                Their plumes of blinding spray.<br><br>
                
                Amroth beheld the fading shore<br>
                Now low beyond the swell,<br>
                And cursed the faithless ship that bore<br>
                Him far from Nimrodel.<br><br>
                
                Of old he was an Elven-king,<br>
                A lord of tree and glen,<br>
                When golden were the boughs in spring<br>
                In fair Lothlórien.<br><br>
                
                From helm to sea they saw him leap,<br>
                As arrow from the string,<br>
                And dive into the water deep,<br>
                As mew upon the wing.<br><br>
                
                The wind was in his flowing hair,<br>
                The foam about him shone;<br>
                Afar they saw him strong and fair<br>
                Go riding like a swan.<br><br>
                
                But from the West has come no word,<br>
                And on the Hither Shore<br>
                No tidings Elven-folk have heard<br>
                Of Amroth evermore.</p> <br><br></div>
